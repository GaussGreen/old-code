       includes all symbols out of the credit directory. Many symbols
       are automatically linked because they are used by other classes
       which are already included.

       An example of symbols that could be dropped would be an entire class
       representing volatility. For example FlatVol might be dropped since
       the only references might be throught the abstract parent class. */
